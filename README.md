# drench

## BACKGROUND + ACCESS
An accessible version of the classic game "Flood", that can be found [HERE](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/flood.html).

Website to the game can be found [HERE](https://kattaque.github.io/drench/). The purpose of this project is to create a better online experience for users with limited physical mobility. It is specifically targeted to be available and usable for the sighted, the visually impaired (color-blind), and those without fine motor skills. As a color-based grid game, it helps build visual-spatial skills and strategic thinking. 

The goal of the game is to fill the grid with the same color in as few moves as possible. The game will comprise of various levels, with varying levels of difficulty. The game board would start off small, but wil enlarge for the higher levels: easy (5x5), medium (7x7), hard (12x12), and very hard (20x20).

 As previously stated, the goal is to fill the entire grid with the same color, starting with the upper left and selecting neighboring colors until the whole board is covered with one paint color. The input will be using speech recognition API on GitHub that is adapted to  recognize voice commands as input. Players can choose the colors simply by saying the color name out loud. In addition to the game being motor-impaired-friendly, it so that some of those who are visually impaired could also play. Through research, it's been found that pastel color palettes are preferred by those who are colorblind. The board also fills the whole screen so that itâ€™s easily viewable.
 
For maximum audience reachability, the game will only require a keyboard and/or a mouse. A touch screen is also usable.
